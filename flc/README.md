# flc
Formal Logic Calculator is a sort of milestone build of the overall fli project. It merely implements a sentential logic 
expression evaulation algorithm which takes in strings of wff's and logical values (i.e. T, F) and prints the result of the 
logical operations ~, ->, <->, v, and ^ which are negation, conditional, biconditional, disjunction, and conjunction, respectively.

##Usage
Invoke the flc by merely running it (i.e. ./flc). It will then read logical expressions from stdin, printing the results to stdout.

##Build
Simply clone the repo and run Make. If you have issues, then you probably are on windows, and have bigger problems than being unable to build my program.
