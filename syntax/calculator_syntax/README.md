# Formal Logic Calculator 
At this point, this is intended to be a sentential logic calculator *language parser* that takes no variables, has no symbol table, pretty printing, or extended features.
The actual algorithms for calculating the resultant values will first be sketched out in ../calculator_algorithms.

### Intended Features in the Short Term:
- [x] Provisional specification for the syntax, lexical elements, formal grammar and language that this simple calculator will support.
- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser (linked with the lexer)
- [x] Abstract Syntax Tree (.h/.c implementation)
- [x] Abstract Syntax Tree (link it with the parser)
- [ ] Routines for semantic analysis of the AST
