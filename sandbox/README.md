# Sandbox
This directory contains the results of the efforts to explore syntactical and grammatical options for the 
underlying formal language that will be used by the project to represent sentential logic. Grammar and Alphabet spec(s) and 
prototype lexers and parsers, along with logic "calculator" programs may be worked on and contained here.
