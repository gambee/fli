/* pdt.dot
 * This file contains a (graph) description of a Finite State Pushdown
 * Transducer that takes as its input string sentential logic expressions
 * (without variables) in reverse polish notation and computes the result
 * of its evalutation.
 *
 * NOTE: At this time this graph is an incomplete representation of such an
 * 		 automataon. Not every state has transition declared for every possible
 *		 input. Also, no 'output' actions are specified for this graph. Such 
 *		 error-handling and clerical sorts of tasks were omitted to reduce 
 *		 clutter and prevent the readers of this graph from being distracted
 *		 from the more significant semantics of its spefification.
